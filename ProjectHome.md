# SMS Backup viewer #
A tool to view the XML files created from the Android App "SMS Backup" from Michele Valentini (https://market.android.com/details?id=org.bobarctor.smsbackup)

The SMS Backup app for android is nice but has one shortcoming; No way to view the backups without restoring them, which wipes out all current data in your SMS message list. The XML files are stored on the SD card which is great, you can download it. but it's an eyesore to go through.

This was my solution to be able to view it WITHOUT having to wipe out my existing SMS messages.

### Features ###
```
   - Drag and Drop Support
   - Enables you easily view the SMS XML Logs from SMS Backup
   - Search and remove let's you drop unwanted text off each file name.
   - Places them into a list which can be sorted by:
      - Message ID
      - Thread ID
      - Name
      - Date
      - Body
   - Progress bar
   - On messages that are a reply it puts the name as "Me => [OtherPerson'sName (Phonenumber)]"
```
